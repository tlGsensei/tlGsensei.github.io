Share my life and moving moments.

When we change the contents of any page, there may be at most 10 mimutes delay before you can see the updated pages. So if you want to keep up with the new changes, please press "F5" to refresh your browser.

The page is undone and keeps updated. You can see changelog to figure out the differences and changes of my project.

Due to the delay of Github site, you may have trouble seeing the pictures in articles. I suggest you to use Google Chrome or FireFox to visit.
